This afternoon, I tweeted a brief joke about a well-known NYT op- Ed columnist.
It got 9 likes and 0 retweets. I did not @ him. He does not follow me.
He just emailed me, cc&#x27;ing my university provost. He is deeply offended that I called him a metaphorical bedbug.

Alright fine... here is the email:

Dear Dr. Karpf,
Someone just pointed out a tweet you wrote about me, calling me a &quot;bedbug.&quot; I&#x27;m often amazed about the things supposedly decent people are prepared to say about other people -- people they&#x27;ve never met -- on Twitter. I think you&#x27;ve set a new standard.
I would welcome the opportunity for you to come to my home, meet my wife and kids, talk to us for for a few minutes, and then call me a &quot;bedbug&quot; to my face. That would take some genuine courage and intellectual integrity on your part. I promise to be courteous no matter what you have to say.
Maybe it will make you feel better about yourself.
Please consider this a standing invitation. You are more than welcome to bring your significant other.
Cordially,
Bret Stephens
