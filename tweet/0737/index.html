Dear visitor,
In order to protect my concentration and sanity I have decided to implement a door policy:
Door open: Very welcome to knock and come in, yes I would love to have a chat!
Door closed: Please do not knock at my door or come in unless you have urgent business.* I am extremely easily distracted and I will talk to you until the end of time instead of writing my dissertation.
Never: come in without knocking.
&quot;List of things that are urgent business: -the building or someone is on fire - you&#x27;re bringing me coffee
- revolution
- there is a dog">
