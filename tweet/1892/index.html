Havelock Road in Southall - London&#x27;s &#x27;Little India&#x27; - is finally to be renamed Guru Nanak Road. This is a big deal. Havelock Rd was
named after the colonial British general who fought in the Sikh wars &amp; later suppressed the 1857 Uprising. It is home to London&#x27;s largest gurudwara.
