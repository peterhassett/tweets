    <meta property="og:image:alt" content="Wow, this extract from Wolff&#x27;s book is a shocking insight into Trump&#x27;s mind:
On his first night in the White House, President Trump complained that the TV in his bedroom was broken, because it didn&#x27;t have &quot;the gorilla channel&quot;. Trump seemed to be under the impression that a TV channel existed that screened nothing but gorilla-based content, 24 hours a day.
To appease Trump, White House staff compiled a number of gorilla documentaries into a makeshift gorilla channel, broadcast into Trump&#x27;s bedroom from a hastily-constructed transmission tower on the South Lawn. However, Trump was unhappy with the channel they had created, moaning that it was &quot;boring&quot; because &quot;the gorillas aren&#x27;t fighting&quot;.
Staff edited out all the parts of the documentaries where gorillas weren&#x27;t hitting each other, and at last the president was satisfied. &quot;On some days he&#x27;ll watch the gorilla channel for 17 hours straight,&quot; an insider told me. &quot;He kneels in front of the TV, with his face about four inches from the screen, and says encouraging things to the gorillas, like &#x27;the way you hit that other gorilla was good&#x27;. I think he thinks the gorillas can hear him.&quot;
