This is my favourite story about him by a country mile

(Screenshot of interview)

Julia Stiles (co-star, Bourne&#x27; films): After The Bourne Ultimatum came out, there was a premiere in London. Prince actually came to it, then got tickets for the cast to come see him [perform]. We were summoned into a room to meet him [after the show]. Matt said, &quot;So you live in Minnesota? I hear you live in Minnesota.&quot;
Damon: Prince said, &quot;I live inside my own heart, Matt Damon.&quot;
